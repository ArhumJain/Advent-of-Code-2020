## _Arhum Jain's Advent of Code 2020 Solutions_
I am an aspiring programmer with much to learn and experience to gain
This repo is so that I can receive feedback and advice on my solutions for Advent of Code 2020
which are not always the best or the most effective. Any support on how to write cleaner and more effective 
code is welcome! Other than, feel free to take a look at my solutions which you can make use of as 
well - if you want. I usually solve each day in the morning rather than at 9 PM on the night before which
is when the puzzles for the next day are released. Usually I will have the problem solved before 12 PM
depending on the difficulty. Some more challenging problems can take longer than that! Thanks for
taking interest in this repo,

_Happy Coding!_
